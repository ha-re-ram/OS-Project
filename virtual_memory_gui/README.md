# Virtual Memory GUI Tool

This project is a GUI-based educational tool for visualizing how virtual memory works in an Operating System.

## Features
- Simulates Paging with FIFO and LRU algorithms
- Displays virtual-to-physical memory mapping
- Tracks page faults
- Step-by-step simulation

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.6).
2. Run the GUI:
```bash
python vm_gui.py
```
3. Enter a page reference string (e.g., `0 1 2 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 4`).
4. Choose the algorithm (FIFO or LRU).
5. Click "Start Simulation", then "Next Step" to proceed.

## Screenshots
